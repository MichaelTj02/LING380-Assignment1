be here if you need me let's get into it let's get into it let's get into it let's start off Rob with the whole zalinsky Trump issue which got a little bit out of control so we all saw a clip of the exchange between the two that the moment zalinski started threatening that hey you have some things that you have to worry about as well and that wasn't a good look when he went there we've seen this clip Rob if you can fast forward to maybe 30 seconds when he tries to say things about President Trump and he's not right there that's good watch this clip here I'm sure you've seen it but we'll repeat it go ahead Rob people in your military and do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to trying to prevent the destruction of your country lot lot of questions let's start from the beginning first of all during the war everybody has problems even you but you have nice ocean and don't feel now but you will feel it in the future God bless know God bless God bless you will not have don't tell us what we're going to feel we're trying to solve a problem don't tell us what we're going to feel I'm not telling you because you're in no position to dictate that remember this you're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel d we're going to feel very good feel influ we're going to feel very good and very strong you're right now not in a very good position you've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position and he happens to be right about from the very beginning of the war you're not in a good position you don't have the cards right now with us you start having cards right now you don't you're playing card you're G so while this is happening president Trump comes out on Truth social and says that an end to Ukraine war with Russia was very very far away writing this is the most this is the worst statement that could have been made by zilinski and America will not put up with it much longer it is what I was saying this guy doesn't want there to be peace as long as he has America's back in and Europe in the meeting they had with zilinski stated flatly that they cannot do the job without us probably not a good uh not a great statement to have been made in terms of show of strength against Russia what are they thinking after a fire re overal off his Clash Trump said you're either going to make a deal or we're out and if we're out you'll fight it out I don't think it's going to be very pretty so that's being that being said Rob yesterday story is trending that President Trump ends the eight to Ukraine okay and we saw that I don't know if you have that or not Rob where he flat out says we're ending the a to Ukraine is this the clip Rob uh so I have Fox news reporting I don't have Trump but I can find it no it's okay this is the one they're saying they're ending da this is the clip I've seen this as well playus clip tomorrow Brian our Lucas thinon reporting the United States is pausing all US military aid to Ukraine until president Trump determines the ukrainians show a commitment of good faith peace negotiations that's according to a senior Trump Administration telling Fox this is not a permanent termination of Aid it is a pause the orders are going out right now the official said this in response to Ukrainian president zelinsky's conduct over the last week and his words over the weekend um so it's all stopping now keep in mind the a is done I'll show the next story and then I want to re get a reaction from you guys here pull up the story from CBS I just sent you Rob so while all this stuff is going on Putin's been saying what does this guy really want and what did NATO promise they would never do and what did Bush promise what did US promise what did NATO promise we will never want to do anything with Ukraine being part of NATO now watch this Ukraine zalinski says he would give up presidency in exchange for peace and NATO membership this guy is trying to negotiate a deal into getting into NATO all of this stuff that's taking place back and forth back and forth back and forth and then the UK prime minister UK president comes out defending him saying the mineral deal is not going to happen it's not this it's not that so they're making it even tougher go and play this clip Rob first we will keep the military aid flowing and keep increasing the economic pressure on Russia to strengthen Ukraine now second we agreed that any lasting peace must ensure Ukraine's sovereignty and security and Ukraine must be at the table third in the event of a peace deal we will keep boosting Ukraine's own defensive capabilities to deter any future Invasion fourth we will go further to develop a coalition of the willing to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee the peace not every nation will feel able to contribute but that can't mean that we sit back you can pause it instead Tom your thoughts on the story so boy where do you go on this um I think everybody has seen the all of the uh historical constructs and there's been a lot of people that um old speeches and things that are on Twitter showing where this started and this didn't start with Russia's Invasion this goes back to 2014 this goes back into overthrowing a rightful president and putting in a a new um uh regime in Ukraine and this goes back to the progressive Eastward expansion of NATO and you know Russia keeps saying hey stop you said you weren't going to do this can you stop that and then the Baltic states and then the southern states and then Georgia and he like stop and so now you've got Europe over there saying we're going to back you up we're going to do this and back you up you have to remember where this started and no Russia shouldn't have invaded there and just the the the heartfelt loss of life that's happened in Ukraine to all the average citizens is just horrifying the count that everybody keeps talking about is a million ukrainians have lost their lives in this conflict this is horrible there's like 10 cids and so you know I look at all of Europe you're going to back up this guy and give him a back stop that gives him no he doesn't have to find a peace deal with Russia he doesn't have to negotiate with Russia he can keep flipping off Putin because these people are going to back him up now so how do how do you get Ukraine to the to the table to say hey look you know we got to find a A Way Forward on this and to me I find it very very difficult and what's equally guling to me is there's things that the media and the other foreign countries aren't talking about it's just how much we gave as grants versus giving as loans can you pull up that chart Rob can you pull up that chart just go straight to my it's complicated but underneath I'm pretty I'm pretty I'm pretty twerked twerk twerked twerk he doesn't twerk no no TW Adam I know you're I just was out of shape come on your page check this out 100% BBC okay look at this government support to Ukraine blue is loans Green is Grant great is guaranteed look at us only a third of what we've given as a loan green is Grant okay look at EU they're like yeah we'll give you a loan but you better pay it back EU knows how to negotiate and get the money back a little bit of Grant a little bit of guarantee and then you have everybody else the question becomes why are taxpayers why are we just giving it away why can't we get the money back why can't he go negotiate on behalf of Americans why can't Trump go and say Here's the things that I want if you don't give it to us we're not supporting you anymore why not and by the way if kir is comfortable giving more money to them go ahead and do it you guys got money go give it to them we don't need to do it if you feel so compelled anybody in you EU should be more interested in the protection of Ukraine than us us should be interested in Canada and Mexico everybody else in EU pay up you go do it we understand we support your decision but you ought to risk that money with your taxpayers not us so Tom you're making a very good point with that Jillian what do you think about this can I one more how do you think EU is going to get paid back their loan if if there's no money in Ukraine the thing that they don't want us to have that's right Jillian I actually want to play Devil's Advocate and ask a few questions I'm 100% with Tom I think there were a million off-ramps I do think we provoked this or not us As Americans but our companies provoked this because we've taken their farming land we as you've educated me on Black Rock and JP Morgan have a $400 billion doll contract to go in and rebuild so that's said Ukraine is the loser across the board as far as I can tell they have lost all of their resources in in from what I can again what I'm observing why would we not honestly I'm not saying continue to fund the war 100% no nobody wants that we want this over but why would we not say listen if you do this deal and you're so convinced that Putin's going to overstep should it happen again you know we'll step in we'll help protect you why would we not do that if we are invested in extracting minerals and our you know big a companies like ADM and Monsanto and Cargill are using their land they're leasing the Bread Basket there what would be the reason to not give them that Assurance us why would we not is what you're asking why would we not provide the assurance that if Russia broke the ceasefire because this is what he's saying he's like you can't trust him he's going to break the ceasefire he's going to come in he's gonna right and Trump is saying no way no you have the Assurance here if we do business with you that's not going to happen and he's going I just don't feel that confident I'm I'm not a zilinsky Advocate I'm just asking you why would we not say like we're sure but if if if he oversteps and if he breaks the ceasefire blah blah blah we'll Provide support not that I want to be doing that but if we're taking their minerals I can kind of see why the request is there yeah so to me uh kind of what we talked about last night is the following if a company hires a new CEO okay John has been running this company as a COO for the last 10 years I get hired the new Co comes in they bring new executive team the first thing the new CEO does is they go through all the contracts that we have to try to see a way to negotiate so if I'm an insurance CEO and I go to another company and I have experience and I know all these carriers I'll go to a company I'll look at all their contracts and I'll say hey I'm sorry this carrier only pays you guys 130 yeah only 130% yes we and you got how much premium you send I'm 40 million a year why are you guys only getting 130 I was getting 145 and I was only sending them 20 million here are you kidding me no this is R let me call them up right hey Johnny Yes is it true that you guys only pay us 130 points and we give you 40 million a year yes you got 24 hours to bump that up to 150 million so I make my money back of the last six years for the company or else we're no longer doing business with you that premium is going somewhere else that's what the new Co is doing now the previous CEO why did he do 130 I don't know what were the side favors was he invited to events was he invit I don't know all those side deals I was not in the negotiating room so to me it's not just about why wouldn't we back them up you think Trump wants a World War you think Trump wants people to go out there another World War III happening under his watch he doesn't want that he doesn't want any of that stuff but it seems zinsky thinks again I'm I'm just playing devil's advocate for the for the people that I argue with on the other side and because I'm not an expert in geopolitics but if I'm zalinsky I'm going to want the Assurance if I'm giving away 50% of our minerals I would ask the same thing no I wouldn't do it that I've already given you money taxpayers have already given you money what are we getting for reassurance for what we've given you the last three and a half four years what is our reassurance not yours look so think about the Gated Community you live in okay if in your gated community there's a what do you call it when every month no there's a meeting that they have an Tom what is that called home h meeting so that I never go to but let's just say there's a home own Association that Jennifer goes to right and then she gives me an go so these home owner association meeting imagine we go in there and one of the guys says Hey the security we got is 85 years old he's letting people in we had another car that was robbed I think we got to hire a new security firm and the guys have to be former military licensed to carry and we have to pay that to do that currently we're paying this guy 17 bucks an hour to do that it's going to be $32 an hour that means all of us instead of paying $600 a month it's going to go to $900 a month and then everybody looks around and says you know what I'm with it let's do it great now why should we all care about that Homeowner Association because we all live in that gated community now trip out on this you ready yeah let's say another gated community in for laudel that is 3,000 miles away from where you live okay comes up to you and says hey guys check this out our community is not safe we're getting robbed we want you to contribute to our Homeowner Association to make our gated community safer and you're sit they're saying wait a minute what did you say yeah we want your money to protect our gated community so what does this mean wait a minute I'm already protecting my gated community what is our Gator Community it's called us Canada Mexico it's called we spend 3.4% of our annual budget Mexico spends 7% Canada spends 1.1 of their GDP military expenditure we're already making our gated community safer why do we need to make Ukraine's gated community safer that's the question and Trump asking the right question because if that's the case EU should be paying more money than everybody else not us we're not on there all the time we'll contribute a little bit but number one more than anybody else with nothing no 100% not but get and this and then I'll drop it it's just simply because the reason we would make their gated community safer is out of zelinsky's mouth I didn't take money I got weapons well who profited off the weapons are defense contractors who had who was forced to reform their laws about farming land and give up leases to our big a companies they were so now our defense contractors are making money our big a contractors are making money and now we're going to be taking their minerals and I I'm not saying that we shouldn't be defending I'm simply saying if we are stripping them of resources and then you've got Black Rock and GP Morgan going in to rebuild that would be our investment in their gated community and what happens let's just say now zalinsky signs it and Putin does go in contrary to what Trump says and what I don't believe will happen but he does go in and zalinsky is right then what actually do we do now that we are invested there would we step up to the plate if Putin decided to push further okay so you're assuming 100% of all the money that was given is all military weapons there's AIDS there's humanitarian Aid there's Cash There's different things that was given what that number of the $3 billion or whatever the numberers $140 billion we don't know we want to know that so the claims of the kind of money he's making the claims of what they're doing when they're coming through all of that stuff that people talk about you know whether it's true or not I don't think we'll ever find out if we do it's because someone's going to come out and someone's getting killed okay if if something happens to zinski that's the part in regards to Russia let's let's talk if we're talking about the military-industrial complex that these guys want all these contracts to be able to sell more weapons no problem we talked about this again last night the one number no one talks about what is Putin in the way of think about it what is Putin in the way of the one thing nobody talks about Rob can you Google which country has the most natural resources okay and folks if you're listening to this I don't want you to say anything I want them to guess shocking can you don't don't show it oh you showed it already can you guess how many people how much money of Natural Resources Russia has that Putin is in the way of other companies going in there and having access to this you know what the numbers you think it's 10 trillion you think it's 20 trillion 22 trillion 23 trillion Rob can you pull out what the number is with r with Russia 75 trillion is what they unable and by the way can you pull up the ranking of number one to number two to number three to number four to number five ranking of countries by natural resources jeez that's not my natural resources there's a leader bullet many we're at 45 trillion they're nearly 2x us go to the next one Rob okay Saudi Arabia is 34 all that oil Russia 75 trillion Canada 33 Brazil 22 yeah where is Venezuela where is everybody else you're talking about 75 trillion so where's China this he's in the way of somebody wanting to get access to that right there so look at Canada Iran is 27 China's 23 trillion Brazil's 22 Australia's 20 Iraq's 16 Venezuela that's like oil oil oil is sixth of what Russia is he these people that are these big Behemoth companies like the black rocks the state streets the vanguards they're like hey man we want to get access to that we want to do business there there's a guy in the way saying you can't they have to get rid of that guy wow this was same case with Iran sha was in the way they got to get rid of that guy they got to find they got to get rid of this guy so Putin's not playing ball I'm not sitting here telling you is an angel and all this other stuff I do want to play One Clip to get your reaction on it okay you've done work with Bill and Hillary Clinton and you had a very good experience with them I did just so you know I I I I listen I've changed teams but but in all transparency I I I worked with the administration on health matters how were they to you they were they were very lovely to me Bill is extraordinarily charismatic though I mean for sure you he's got it down to a science this guy will remember a story about your sick Chihuahua 10 years later he's like how's Baxter how's your little dog and you're just like wow I I mean okay so would you say he's one of the best politicians the last 40 would you put him ahead of Obama yes I would as well okay yes this is when he was asked about Putin in 2013 look at his answer go ahead Rob look Mr Putin is got he got all he's very smart well you know him better than most people yeah what was he like behind closed doors away from you know the sort of the public utterances smart and um remarkably um we had a really good blunt relationship how blunt brutally blunt ever like in know fisty C no but I think you know I think the right strategy most of the time is but it's frustrating to people in your line of work you should be brutally honest with people in private and then if you want them to help help you try to avoid embarrassing them in public now sometimes they do things which make it impossible for you to keep quiet but by and large I found all the people I dealt with appreciated it if I told them the truth how I honestly felt and what our interests were and what our objectives were and they also appreciated it when I didn't kick them around in public for as long as I couldn't kick them around so I I you know that's my experience did Putin ever Rene on a personal agreement he made to you he did not so behind closed doors he could be trusted he kept his word in all the deals we made bingo bingo so that's Bill Clinton so do you trust Bill Clinton is telling the truth do you think he's telling a lie you know what you said last night that was so interesting about you this is why I love you so much you said such a unique thing last night we're sitting there it's very obvious you're not a tate fan no okay I won't tell the whole context of the convers because it's private what we were talking no no no but when I was talking about different individuals and we talk about the different individuals and I said which one of these names do you think would be most honest with you okay I don't think it's necessary for me to give the other names but you said even though I don't agree with him and I can't stand him I think he would tell me the truth even though I would disagree with him right you said that yesterday yes I did okay 100% so so this doesn't mean they're boys this doesn't mean they're kicking it going to kasad D'angelo tonight this doesn't mean they're going to go have sushi and and talk you know hockey Russia and stuff like that no he's just telling you I'm going against the boss that keeps his word okay maybe that's why Trump and Putin get along and Trump and zilinski don't get along maybe that's because zinski is playing games and Putin is just kind of like this is why I am what do you want to do so to me I don't know I'm not in it I don't talk to any of these guys I don't have a relationship with any of these guys I'm just a business guy that's been in weird rooms at a much much much smaller scale that you watch people playing games and then you have to position everybody and say what is that guy trying to do what does he want from this deal how is this guy benefiting what does he fear if this deal gets done those are the things I pay attention to and in this scenario I think Putin's in a way of $75 trillion and a money people are like you guys think 400 billion is money in Ukraine to rebuild that place [ __ ] sou countryes got 75 trillion how the hell do we get that kind of money access to that I think that's what people want that they don't have access to right now and and they're willing to do that to and start World War II that could potentially kill all of us but Pat you me you guys mentioned 2014 I don't know if you guys remember Joe Biden CIA director the past one his name is uh William J Burns in 2008 he was a US ambassador to Russia uh he expressed his concerns regarding Ukraine's potential NATO membership uh in a confidential cable called net means net Russia's NATO enlargement Readiness he wrote Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of all red lines for Russia Elite not just Putin he said this could potentially split the country into okay and what what people don't like I don't get what people it's not Computing you're you're trying to put NATO push missiles and bases closer to Russia if somebody right now Jillian was like you know what China was like of we're coming into Mexico never allow it we're going to build a couple Bas we never allow it we would hold on we would bomb and fight everybody well it was called the Cuban Miss and thank you which almost caused War but what what drives me crazy we we kind of went IRL on that one yeah we did but what what drives me crazy is this this blind liberal and is a liberal support with the I stand with Ukraine okay which they can't even point it out on a map okay and Ukraine doesn't even align with our values for instance first off gay marriage is illegal in Ukraine so all these people that have the pride flag with the Ukrainian flag you're an idiot it's like the gays for Gaza go to Gaza go to Gaza and see how lovely there go they don't they don't support what they what they uh what they fight for and the number the two thing as as two veterans Jillian what they're doing right now men in Russia I showed it a little clip of Rob can you P pull this up and I wanted the audio of the guy screaming they are running up to grown men young guys fathers Sons uncles and grabbing them it's called cons conscription they're grabbing them throwing them in a van and putting them in the front lines to die okay what happened to my body my choice body autonomy these people are doesn't exist mean yeah yeah it doesn't mean [ __ ] these guy like is a is there audio on this we show can you imag yeah but listen to the audio the guy screaming he's walking his dog and then this is the Ukrainian officials or military you're look at it he's running he knows and he's gone front lines and he's gone and Rob you can jump a little bit forward Robbie the dog is going you think that guy wants the fight yeah look at this grabbing him screaming doesn't want to go okay Rob you can do that so it's just it drives me crazy of all this support all of our tax dollars when at the end of the day you don't even know what the hell I stand with Ukraine when I see that sign I stand with Ukraine it should say I bend over for Ukraine I'm tired of it all the money all the and you nailed it it's follow the money and Ukraine remember Russia it's like Putin Putin price hike Putin this he's the B give me give me a break that whole that sales pitch isn't it's not selling anymore to me I I couldn't agree with you more I I'm just saying if we're trying to bring an end that that's all and that we are I feel like Ukraine has been raped pillaged and plundered and zalinsky is just a puppet and we obviously installed him through the National Endowment for democracy and funded that coup that Tom mentioned in 2014 or at least it sure seems that way and this has all been driven by money just like you say follow the money I just feel like we got or not we I don't want to say we cuz it's not us in the room it's not Americans but whoever wanted this got what they wanted whoever provoked this don't move NATO Eastward we added 14 countries put it on Putin's border like obviously you know net means Ned you knew what you were doing you got what you wanted and that's the only part where I'm like well okay you got the Farmland you got the minerals you got the money money for the bombs you got the contract to rebuild you can grab all of their resources even further and 35 exit I just wonder why that he wouldn't be like sure sure sure if he comes in we'll we'll step in but I I hear everything you're saying and I know Americans don't want that I'm not saying continue funding it but I'm gonna come to you Rob can you do me a favor pull up a poll from Guardian that Thomas Souls Twitter account whoever runs that account we've spoken multiple times great job running that account Rob it's it's in the note section that I have if yeah okay it's fine no no go go where you're going it's fine go right there go lower lower lower lower some of these guys tweet so often that you go like so low till you find it so then go go to the notes section Rob that I have go to the notes section if you go there you'll see a poll this is a poll asking how people okay in EU most Europeans how they feel about Ukraine and it's such an interesting thing because it's two separate polls right there okay zoom in so zoom in first to read the top most Europeans feel Ukraine is not getting enough Western support okay but watch before you go to the next one are the current measures against Russia and Aid given to Ukraine enough to prevent a Russian Victory red is not enough light Grays don't know blue is enough more than enough look at that 66% say not enough Denmark Sweden Spain lowest one is France 52% not enough the middle one gray is like I don't know and then the blue is yeah it's more than enough 12 16 13 11 20 15 18% now they changed the question this is the guardian and guardian is supportive of Ukraine go a little bit lower and see what the next question is however only a minority think their country should increase the support no [ __ ] Sherlock how should your country manage support giving to Ukraine increase it maintain it don't no reduce it now look at it increase only 29% Sweden look at Denmark go to the top Denmark was number one at what 60 something percent it's not enough what be gets this entitlement Pat God this is not and then go lower and then they're like what gets this point it's like they work half the work week that we do they've got you know their healthc care is covered and it's all because we pay for the majority of the defense what is this entitlement that I I I'm I am baffled by it by the way wouldn't you be like excited if a dumb American negotiator agrees to pay more towards a country that's a border to you than you how awesome of a negotiate you got to give credit to EU for negotiation they did with Biden's Administration you're not even bordered to this country but you care more than we do send the money but we won't look at these numbers it's embarrassing so socialism is anytime people want to give your money but they just don't want it to be their money that's what they have a problem with Tom no that's EXA that's exactly right what's very interesting here how many of you think your sisters should go to college and we should and and and that the fund should be there all of three brothers and sisters raise their hands right yes okay so who wants to give up their iPad and their uh summer Sports so that we can put the money for your sisters everybody runs out of the kitchen yeah that's that's exactly Adam well a lot of these countries are already socialist to begin with so they don't mind being taxed at 50% what's 51% because it's already just going to lead to basically they said no but most countries already used to being tax I know what I'm saying is when it comes to should we increase it they're saying no finally so basically it's like when you get pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed at some point you're going to like all right enough's enough yeah but you asked an interesting question earlier about personalities you know people you talk about 2014 what happened nobody gives a [ __ ] about the dabass region I get it people there they talk about this but what what happened in the Russians that were there getting getting shelled seem to care exactly but the world doesn't really care about that what happened in 2019 is really what we should remember cuz in 2019 is when zalinsky got elected right and then shortly after that if you remember this Trump had a perfect call with him and we learned the term quidd Pro Crow remember that you know these buzzword terms that get thrown in the world and then never heard from again like kofifi or whatever happened with that so quid qu Pro quid pro go he's saying uh Rudy Giuliani was apparently pressuring zalinski to investigate Hunter Biden do you remember all this stuff do you remember all this stuff oh yeah okay so he had a perfect call he was basically saying listen listen we're going to give you military assistance but zalinski I'm going to need you to do a little something something for Daddy Trump and then they paraded zalinsky out to the oal office and he's like what do you think about the call report he's like yes I didn't not get pressure like in front of trump sort of very like concessionary towards Trump boom what happens Trump gets impeached for a second time for a call with zalinski so five years later when Trump becomes a president you don't think he remembers maybe yeah aren't you that mother sucker that got me impeached yeah little homie waiting for it and then he gets out of the car and he's like oh look at the little guy I see you dressed up real nice for me buddy good point okay so there's a personal relationship there so it comes down to respect 100% so yeah we're on team Ukraine right we're on the team America America from a policy perspective from a policy perspective right it's not like we're having Putin in the Oval Office but from a personality perspective Trump doesn't respect zalinski what was the whole video of him shaking his whole thing but he oh my gosh we're also you've seen this real SE it's ridiculous um we're not friends with Russia at this point Trump I think wants to have a warmer relationship but get this point he at least respects Putin yes he's a thug yes he's a KGB agent there's your boy yes he's a killer yes if you say something wrong you'll thrown out you get thrown out of a window but Trump in a weird way at least respects Putin has no respect for z c question because you me look at this guy right here you made a great Point why wouldn't Putin like if they're communicating and Trump respects everybody why wouldn't he come to the White House I would you mind it I wouldn't mind Putin coming to have a conversation he's gonna send us uh Sergey lab I understand that but what I'm saying is if that Madonna chess wearing freaking freak probably on cocaine could come there and disrespect the [ __ ] out of us Vladimir Putin's a whole different Beast bro that guy what do you mean you're saying why isn't he why wouldn't he ever come in let me let me let me show this clip that's a good question can I just say one thing just think about it for one second the people you've Ukraine you don't think they've seen this videos thousand they looked at him and they go yeah I'll vote for that guy so what's going on with those people little bit did they really though like I know we was elected but I mean I I don't know I I tend to think was influenced by oh sure I say one thing oh my God J what do you think about that move yeah sorry he's got my vote I actually thought Trump for the vast majority of that meeting was respectful yes I I thought he was I watched the whole thing and for the vast majority I thought he held it together you know there was a arm tap was patient and then and he called JD JD not Mr Vice President like it was building and then Trump lost his [ __ ] but I it was you don't have the cards yeah I I mean but I thought I thought he hung on longer than I expected I mean I agree the thing is Trump actually gave him respect you show up like that dress that's an insult by the way you know what uh we just talked about 75 trillion with Russia here's what Putin said two days ago Rob if you can play that clip Putin's like oh really you guys want to do a mineral deal with Ukraine let me tell you what wals we got here go ahead Rob uncontested leaders when it comes down to rare and rare earth metal result he knows the leverage he has of course hey just so you know guys you talking to come here we got everything to offer you anyways let's go to the next story here wow next story next story I want to get to is working from home and I we have to play this clip of Jamie Diamond uh on how he reacts when this came up and and the way I'm going to go into this R I'm going to I'm going to tell the story of Google what just happened with Sergey Brin and what they're doing at Google talking about the fact that uh Sergey BR tells Google employees that 60 hours a week is the sweet spot for productivity some beg to defer okay Google go found co-founder urge employees working on Gemini to Target about 60 hours a week as The Sweet Spot of productivity writing in a memo competition has accelerated immensely and the final race to AGI is a foot referring to a uh Ai and suggesting they be in the office at least every weekday though he noted some folks put on a lot more but can burn out or lose creativity workplace experts challenge brince view with John toois a university Toronto management professor of course a professor is going to have his opinion who doesn't work but he's telling others how to work tells Business Insider we are we see people taking longer to do the same amount of work than they would when they were fresher due to errors and motivation drops and d d d da and then Cova Jaa favors burstable bandwidth over fixed long hours you work a bit harder on these days but you have to be able to rest and recharge which is a good point but 60 hours right then there's Jamie Diamond and a leaked recording where he loses his [ __ ] is what a lot of people are saying love it okay and here's what he had to say go forward rob a lot of you were on the [ __ ] zoom and you were doing the following okay you know look at your mail sending text to each other about an [ __ ] the other person is okay not paying attention not reading your stuff you know and if you don't think that slows down efficiency creativity creates rudeness and stuff it does okay and when I found out that people are doing that you don't do at my goddamn meetings you go to meeting with me you got my attention you got my focus I don't bring my goddamn phone I'm not sending text to people okay it simply doesn't work and it doesn't work for creativity it slows down decision making and don't give me the [ __ ] to work from home Friday works I I call a lot of people in Friday they're not a goddamn person you get a hold of but here are the problems okay and they are substantial okay which is the Young Generation is being damaged by this that may they may or may not be in your particular staff but they are being left behind they're being left behind socially ideas meeting people in fact my guess is most you live in communities a hell of a lot less diverse than this room every area should be looking to be 10% more efficient if I was ready to Department of 100 people I guarant guantee you if I wanted to I can run it with 90 and be more efficient I guarantee you I could do it just I could do it in my sleep and the notion these bureaucracies I need more people I can't get it done no because you're you're feeling that request that don't need to be done your people going to meetings they don't need to go to someone told me to approve some his wealth management that they had to go to 14 committees I am dying to get the name of the 14 committees and I feel like firing 14 chairman of committees I can't stand it anymore now you have a choice you don't have to work at JP Morgan so the people of you who don't want to work at the company that's fine with me I'm not I'm not mad at you don't be mad at me it's a free country you can walk with your feet you know but this company's going to set our own standards and do it our own way thank you and and I've had it with this kind of stuff and you know I I come in you know I've been working seven days a goddamn week since covid and I come in and I where's everybody else whether here and there and the zooms and the zooms don't show up people say they didn't get stuff so that's not how you run a great company we didn't build this great company by doing that by doing the same semi disease [ __ ] that everybody else does I love it Tom your thoughts well F first of all I love what he's saying and let's break into some of the major parts he talks about individual development uh Tim Armstrong of Verizon's oath which was Verizon media man took it in the chops when he came out and he said I'm already seeing and we were only 6 months the co co I'm already seeing people working from home that are not getting the ability to develop that want to raise so they want to be promoted the manager and they haven't been around people and they haven't been developing so number one is development and J he's absolutely right the the overall umbrella though these are the standards that make this company great and I am leading this company and this is the way I'm going to do it and so he's not out there to say I'm going to vote for the average he called it a disease he I'm not here to vote for average these are the standards that make JP Morgan great if you want to work for JP Morgan work for me and here's my here's what I think about it and you get development out of it but also I want to eliminate focus and distraction people do it to me you don't do that at my meetings when I'm at my meetings I set my phone aside you have my focus you have my attention and so he's absolutely correct as far as I'm concern if other people want to do it differently they can do it differently and by the way what was Sergey br talking about competition you said competition AI is is heating up it is not a given that our Gemini Project is going to be successful and by the way I think 60 hours a week is about what we need to do here because this is a competitive thing and and we could we could lose a lead here that's what Sergey Britain's talking about but what are they both talking about we're leading these companies and if you want to work here this is the way it's going to be and why do people not respect that Jullian I think it's a generation thing I you know as a gen xer I remember when kenberg said if you don't come in on Saturday don't even bother coming in on Sunday and that was the culture you know Elon Musk said here you know you [ __ ] about burning the midnight oil and in China they're burning the 3:00 a.m. oil and we're losing like AI I mean look what deep seek just did so for me as a gen xer that is music to my ears but try to tell that to a kid who's gen Z and you know what's fascinating is that you're entire team here is filled with young aggressive hungry kids thank you and I cannot figure out thank you thank you on and I can't figure out what you've done to condition them to work like their Gen X because I I you know I meet with these kids I will not take an executive assistant because every time I sit down with one of them they're like well what's the what's the vacation time and and what's the pay and what are my benefits not hey I researched your company I see that you do X Y and Z I think I can contribute this to the table based on my background and that like you don't have that anymore when I was a kid you showed up first and you left last and that's how you got ahead so I you know I love it but is that realistic for America and for our younger generation I I don't know Adam well have you ever heard Jamie Diamond talk like that I've never seen Jamie Diamond in public well was leaked I mean so you know what's going on behind closed doors he's a freaking badass I love him I mean he he Dro he dropped a g damn word probably seven times other than that wow I mean you can understand understand what type of leader he is but I think it's so interesting that in some capacities you have like let's just use two archetypes you have the Jamie Diamond of the world who's basically saying work your ass off I'm in here seven days a week go go go Sergey Bren is a billionaire top 10 he's a founder of Google right yeah top 10 richest billionaire in the world and then you have the Bernie Sanders crew who's like 4 day work weeks 30 hour work weeks Divergent Pathways the Siesta Spain lifestyle everything's covered so and your college are going to pay for that we're going to pay for everything take your pick yeah and well to me it's almost as if you know and because a majority of this with the Zoomers and stuff he's talking about is co co was such an impact that people started working from home and guess what comfortable The Drifters they're hanging out they're home they're not doing trust me I know shitload of them and they're still doing it so they get comfortable just like what you're seeing with Doge with all these federal employees they don't want to go back like they're like wait a minute you're calling me out on my [ __ ] how dare you how dare you point out what the hell I'm doing wrong I think coob was one of those main ones that really got everybody just to chill out and be like I'm what I could still do it at home and the quiet quitting oh yeah I love that that's when they don't answer the phone quiet quitting they just literally you know you know what fake it and continue to make it I I don't know how it's fascinating last time when we got in the car after we had dinner what did I say about John Carlo and and and uh absolutely amazing things and John Carlo was like one of the biggest surprises ever right when we got in the car we're likeing what a great dinner amazing it's like you know what it was it didn't take long to realize there's a connection it's not an act nobody was acting but let me tell you if we had five other people at the table they would have been so annoyed by us hund I think so there could have been people at the table that would have been so annoyed by us because like attracts like so when you're talking about the genzies that are here and the guys that are young that are working great I didn't make them that way found us meaning they're like that and they found a home here they came here and then they realize what the culture is like what I'm doing with they're like [ __ ] this isn't just an act Pat pry talks and they do it few things I wrote down here with this when I had my guys and I'm building insurance company and I would hear guys use their faith and their family as an excuse to not work card it was so funny to me well listen you know uh uh you care more about money and success than I do what's important to me as my kids I'm like oh really yeah oh wow what a noble guy you are oh you're so amazing you care more about your kids than I do yeah that's fantastic so your kids you think you want your kids to do what you tell them to do or you think they're going to do what you're doing you're doing there's more caught than taught in parenting there's more caught than taught in parenting your kids are going to watch you stay home and be a daddy being at home at the kids all the time when they age they're going to do the same thing they're going to be home my kids come here they see how they're working they see what the energy is like they see competition they want to be the same way as well that's the different energy that you're giving them family so many people use a family well it's because of this it's because of that I have want to be around my and you're if you actually put a camera on their house what they were doing they're watching watching TV they're watching YouTube videos they're W it's not quality time that's not called quality time you're wasting it right but the other part that's very interesting with this and I love what Jamie said I absolutely love Jaimie had the luxury of being the executive assistant of Sandy wild at American Express let me say this one more time Sandy wild the former CEO of City Group when he was at American Express as an executive Jaimie was his assistant he was his EA let me say this again Jamie Diamond was the EA to Sandy wild Sandy WS one of the biggest deal makers of all time the guy was a badass mother you know what he was a beast and then the issue happened when he gave Jamie a promotion and jimie started doing really well Jaime was able to Shadow somebody that was a killer he learned from somebody he watched someone like oh my God so this is what it takes to compete at the high you are part of the luckiest Community if you ever work under somebody where you get a chance to see what it really looks like to compete at the highest level you're so lucky if you you're able to witness that Jamie did took advantage of it now is the SE the biggest bank in the world and I'll tell you the last thing we can go to the next story you know what's one of the scariest things about life here's one of the scariest things about life last night we're having dinner okay and dessert shows up and the dessert at this place is the best Mikel takes care of us Mikel brought this pistachio ice cream with a 25 year age balsamic BL that he put on top of the ice cream and the strawberry ridiculous and you're eating it the level of euphoria is it just doesn't how happy you are right and everybody's trying different things and I'm ordering the noi the Alano style and all this other stuff that they bring and then sugar comes and you know what uh Julian said yeah I just don't do that what do you mean I just don't do sugar I made a decision a long time ago I don't do sugar she didn't even say I don't do dessert she says I don't do sugar what do you mean you don't do sugar who talks like that right that's a standard but the main point is the following in life we all have a price to pay yeah you either pay it now or you're going to pay it later so to the geners that are bitching about Jamie Diamond and a boss they're working at that's driving the hell out of them let me give you two prices you could not pay the price now and you could just kind of chill and hang out and relax now in your 20s and your 30s and your 40s you will pay a massive price in your 70s and your 80s and your 60s and that massive price you know what that price is here's what the massive price is let me paint a picture to you and see if you like this or not you're 62 years old you got three kids you have six grandkids those kids of yours for Christmas have a choice between coming to you to spend Christmas and Thanksgiving with you or the in-laws of the family that they married because those guys made better decisions they're in a better place to be able to take care of the kids in a better way you did and you were smoking weed kicking back relaxing chilling out your 20s 30s 40s you're going to sit there in your 60s and 70s in bed and say how come our kids are not with us I wish they were with us babe or you'll be by yourself saying man I wish they was with us that's a painful price the price of working 60 to 80 hours a week in your 20s and 30s give me a flipping break are you kidding me that's the price you're bitching about don't worry wait till that age is in their 60s then call me back man Me by that time and tell me how you feel about the price that you were not willing to pay that price on the back end should scare the crap out of everybody should scare the crap out of everybody when it comes on to alcohol drugs Health relationship finances all of that stuff career you can party all you want you can chill all you want like this Vinnie in 15 years you and I are 61 years old oh my God that's the case buddy oh my God in 15 years that's coming so let's go to the next story Bill Maher a friend of yours Bill Maher endorses Trump like Democrat to run for president when I first read this story I'm like who's he talking about watch who he's talking about go forward Rob Democrats need to find their Trump not the authoritarian part but the part where a politician bonds with everyday Americans because he talks like them and the the good news for Democrats is they have that guy and his name is John fedman oh Jesus go after election instead of curling he doesn't know what ball fetman went to Mara Lago where Trump assumed he was one of the guys from January 6th that's actually that's actually that's you got and afterwards Trump said he's not liberal or conservative he's just a common sense person which is beautiful and that's the kind of gay adjac respect Trump usually reserves for Putin Trump and Federman actually have a lot in common they're both plain spoken anti- elitists who come from money married exotic immigrant ladies went to Ivy League schools and aren't afraid to take on their own party and when the wind catches Trump's hair just right they're both 6'8 look here's the thing voters aren't really Savvy about the issues but they do have it may made it clear what is important to them authenticity balls and Charisma Trump has that package and so does fedman he's only been a senator two years and he's already more famous than most of his colleagues quick I dare you to name this sad looking lady from Washington State who who's been in the senate for 30 years you can't teach Charisma or balls Federman is that rare Democrat who's not afraid to put the woke nonsense Peddlers in his own party in their place saying things like wanting a secure border and realizing that it was out of control that doesn't mean you're a xenophobe or a racist he's been unequivocally prois thoughts you agree with him do you agree with hold on hold on hold on he he's making valid points he does yeah with that said there is something vastly different between fedman and Trump trump is a businessman he is an exceptionally successful businessman and I'm not an economist I am not an expert in geopolitics but as I have sought to understand some of the things he's doing with our economy and our relationships around the world I've come to appreciate listen he does a lot of things I don't like but I've come to appreciate that in many is he's brilliant and it's from talking to people like you learning what's behind what he's doing that's not fedman so while fedman is down to earth and he's not afraid to call [ __ ] on his own party and they're definitely going to need that there's no question fedman is not Trump and I I don't see him when you were talking to me last night explaining how Taiwan is bringing their chips to America and what a big deal that is and why Trump is doing XYZ and then showing me how Tom was breaking down the fact that it's a good deal you think fed's going to be capable of that I don't think so I don't think so I don't think so but maybe maybe what if he does this would it be open to you if he uh uh Rob if you can pull that up if he does this would you think he would have a shot like would that change things for you now vote for would that be like you know what I'm okay with it if this happens only if the beard goes orange Tom your thoughts on this story with fedman look fedman I I have a outome of respect for John fetman because John fetman appears to be very speaking very plainly but when the second coming of Peter Bole and and the monster from Young Frankenstein is the best that you can do sitting on the rits if you everybody knows what I'm talking about nobody know he says it's it's kind of shocking to me um that you know Bill Maher goes down the entire roll call and there's only one guy that he can come out to and he's talking not about positions and business and negotiation he's talking about balls the ability to speak plainly and connect to a populace so it shows even with with with Bill Maher who's not a dumb guy and I've seen a real metamorphosis in his positions that I have a lot of respect for but um you know fman I think it's good that there's somebody in the Democrat Party that that's TR that's taking a moderate position and stepping out like this I think it's a good thing is he their new Messiah no I don't think so I think this is just further proof that the Democratic party has completely lost their way when this guy is the new face of the democratic party potentially it's like what do you guys even stand for at this point I think it's pretty interesting that because he wears a hoodie he's down to earth and he's the common man he went to Harvard he's an elitist I mean like you don't go to Harvard as just some random Schmo so do you remember when Boris Johnson who was the UK prime minister who was like a very smart eccentric smart like eliest guy what he would do I don't know if you want to pull up a picture of him Rob he would be in a meeting let's say we're in a meeting with Pat and I'm like all right Pat cool great everything's good all right I'm gonna go speak to the public he'd ruffle up his hair and get out there and do a little Chris Farley thing you know Billy's here Bobby's here get out there and look like the common man but he wasn't John fedman is not the common man he's a 68 alien looking moderate looking dude who wears a hoodie it's almost like Sam bakman freed where he'd wear shorts on stage you're a freaking Senator bro you're going to show up to the inauguration in a hoodie have a little modum of respect secondly look at his policies he's Medicare for all he's uh pro-union this is how you show up in Winter to the inauguration come on bro it's a joke it's a joke he's a joke so this is is what the Democratic party is so either a gay black asian half [ __ ] lesbian or you're this guy I don't get it what are you Vinnie this first of all for go ahead Vin anything that Bill Mar says at this point about politics you obviously you could tell the Trump derangement syndrome it's still any he can't give no it's just that that on Lane thinking and mind you no I don't totally disagree I don't know where you're going with this I think Bill Mah is actually doing great these days and what very very common sense I think he's being very straightforward I think he's calling out the woke left and he's obviously no fan of certain people on the right yeah he's call but he's been very complimentary of people on the right these days but still has my point Trump derangement syndrome that's the same guy when you talk about Judge of character he says he loves Gavin Nome I love the guy that's cuz he lives in Cali a little bit person relation yeah after his house burnt down maybe may I finish may I finish I don't trust that guy especially when it comes to judging that character because you know what he would vote for gavan for president and this is the same guy by the way let's not forget the left and their choices of who they love Michael avanatti the creepy porn lawyer they were advocating for him to be the president Adam are the same guy they just were let's just talk oh and what did you just say about Bill Martin is Bill Mah and his and his what his woke Progressive you know men in sports and all that [ __ ] yesterday this Senate voted on the protection of women and girls in sports act the bill to protect female athletes from barring biological men from competing the vote was 5145 every single Democrat including your boy fedman voted against it they want men to compete with girls so that woke out that are you kidding me I'm dead serious yesterday every single Democratic senator voted against not one guys all of them Chuck Schumer Sanders Warren Booker all these losers so there goes your you guys want him for president he wants boys to play with girls so that you know it's BS and it's not and by the way and I'm not I hope everything healthwise is good he had a stroke he had to have people in his in his thing type the the Contrition for him he has cardiovascular problems he was admitted to Walter Reed for clinical depression I mean we don't I I want a healthy non think about it this way though on the Democrat side we call him Senator this is how this is how I process this this is how I process this remember when he was campaigning he just looked bad yeah but in the last six months when he does his interviews and he gives answers he actually looks better now when you watch him right but think about it this way if I told you a year ago that in in March 4th whatever today's March 4th you know uh uh Bill Maher is going to say the face of the democratic party is going to be Federman would you have believed me I'd laugh in your you know what that is though because there's no one left true so think about it he didn't say AOC he didn't say Nome he didn't say Tim Waltz who just announced that he's open to the idea of running for president in 2028 he didn't say anybody he didn't even say Stephen A Smith he says Federman where are they at today for them to say something like this and by the way what you just showed right now if they can't sit there and realize what policies resonates with no one in America literally no one in America with these transgender issues allowing men to compete in a Jan what do you think about that when you see this cuz you your reaction to when you saw it they just keep digging dude it it's these are 802 issues 80% of the country is against biological males in girls Sports and there's no point where they're like did anybody get this memo like we're getting our asses kicked on these issues this is not a popular position and they continue to quadruple down I was actually talking to Jen yuger the other day and he said something that made perfect sense he's like somewhere the corporate left and the woke far left had a marriage that none of us knew about like and they they're locked into this path of self-destruction and like okay and the reason I actually understood what bill was saying about Federman is because I do think it's going to be the Democrat that goes this is bananas these guys are crazy and they need a hostile takeover of their party by a guy that's not afraid to call them out on their [ __ ] but after Adam and Vinnie just went to it's certainly not fetman yeah no C that's not the candidate okay next story tariffs Mexico Canada tariffs will be implemented due to unacceptable drug flow Trump says Rob if you can pull up this clip of President Trump and then show what happens to the stock market the Dow yesterday here's president Trump go for it very importantly tomorrow tariffs 25% on Canada and 25% on Mexico and that'll start so they're going to have to have a tariff so what they have to do is build their car plants frankly and other things in the United States in which case they have no tariffs in other words you build and this is exactly what Mr way is doing by building here otherwise they'll build if they did them in Taiwan to send them here they'll have 25% or 30% or 50% or whatever the number may be someday it'll go on up uh but by doing it here he has no tariff so he's way ahead of the game and uh I would just say you know who that is the guy to the right you know who that is the guy to the right that's the that's the chip company right tmsc that's the one that did $100 billion in us okay so tariffs on us while he's saying this Rob can you pull up the Bloomberg story what happened with car prices what they're predicting is going to be happening car prices are poised for $112,000 surge on Trump's new tariffs okay again this is Bloomberg Bloomberg is not a fan of trump um okay here we go president Trump's 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico said on March 4th could Spike Us cars up to $112,000 per study of Anderson economic group led by CEO Patrick Anderson is this it Rob yes play the clip go for it so basically they took Anderson economic took took a look at certain vehicles that are North American assembled I mean they're built in Canada mexo the US um but they also use a number of parts from very various regions and the number you had was $12,000 for for a particular battery electric crossover that's how much the price would go up if these tariffs are implemented I guess tomorrow um it also found that a that a pickup a pickup a gas part pickup would go by $88,000 and then it found a small car around 3600 bucks so there's are various different actual cars that they anonymize and they actually did the analysis the crazy part is it doesn't even include the cost of of Steel and aluminum tariffs that's not even part of this analysis this is just based on what Trump is saying and how makers could try to work around what they'd have to pay more money for in terms of components so it's not exactly a good thing for them I mean not not good for consumers either because those are going to mostly pass down those costs to the consumers uh MSRP so uh pretty inflationary there you know for uh for the for the automakers part they're lobbying to say hey if you're going to do this to us why not do this to the South Korean automakers and the Japanese automakers who are not being tariffed as heavily and they don't make any of their cars in the US right so that's sort of the the give and take there the Balan that's sort of part of the negotiations between the automakers the Commerce department and Trump at this point $12,000 threatening models like Chevrolet Silverado Ford bronos Sport a average car prices uh nearing 50% up 20% from 5 years ago affordability is already strained Anderson noted so you're talking a real number Tom your thoughts on the story here right so if the tariffs stay which are just now implemented and if they stay they will will affect the price of the car after all the cars that are built right now that are currently in inventory or sold because those were built with yesterday's um materials at yesterday's prices after the cars are built today that the raw materials are already landed and are being assembled into cars as we speak and all those are sold then yes you will get to a point where the automakers are buying things at higher prices most of the time manufacturers what's called hedging you know the uh airline industry they hedge and store fuel massive quantities of it to allow these things to go through so what you're seeing is one guy from Anderson consulting which is only one he's only one Auto analyst and he's not even the largest but they're running him up the flag because he's saying exactly what the mainstream media wants to hear that it's all there so could it all come true if this is still still going on in 4 months sure do I think it's going to still be going on in 4 months no because the clout that we have behind our tariffs is much higher than the clout that the other side has I'll give you a great example with the tariffs coming to Europe Europe the EU economic Union managed to come together and through a retaliatory strike and you can go look this up against the United States and they are putting tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Levi's jeans that was an individual action that they took two two weeks ago so we'll teach those Americans will put tariffs on Harley's here in the in in in Europe which aren't don't sell particularly well over there and on Levi's genes which is an American Gene and so you can see the tariffs the market reacts because Market only thinks about future things CEO says the wrong thing on earnings report boom stock mov because that's that's a future the stock market is future speculation but in terms of the real impact on consumers what was the third word in that sentence you just looked at and the Word was could could tariffs set for March 4th could Spike it's all it's all speculative right now these are negotiations these aren't taxes these are negotiations if they're still around months from now yeah you you can have a real live price impact from what I understand of this historically speaking this could go the wrong way but I I don't actually think that's what he's doing I read the art of the deal like I don't know 15 years ago but one of the things that I remember and we've taken away when we negotiate our own contracts is you ask for the Sun the moon the stars and then if you land on the moon you're doing great wonder if this is not exactly that I mean that said and not to relitigate what we discussed last night but when you explained to me that this strategy in particular is what's bringing people into the country to manufacture chips here like what we just saw with Taiwan maybe he's legitimately serious I I I I'm kind of sitting back and waiting to see how everything Trump's doing will play out I think that's the right thing to do I think that's the right thing to do to see what happens Adam your thoughts on this here I think there's one word that is like overplaying in Trump's head overplaying and that's the whole concept of fairness I've been treated very unfairly we've been treated very unfairly they' been taking advantage of us for years so all these words like Retaliator uh was uh reciprocal pricing reciprocal tariffs retaliatory so you remember like it's a weird analogy but you remember when Israel and Iran were trading blows about a year ago Iran attacked Israel oh Israel attacked Iran and they kind of started small and then they went again and then they did them drones and then they the missiles so the point is like once you start something the other the other country is going to make a move and then you're like all right what do we do now and you can stop or Iran maybe needs to respond again and then Israel basically destroyed their en their entire air defense Missile Crisis and then uh missile systems and then Iran sort of been a sleeping giant for for right now the point is this all these countries are going to respond Canada's going to respond I think China's already responded with their own 10% increases on tariffs Mexico's going to respond they're not just going to sit there and take it so Jillian brought up a good point she's like I don't know how this is going to work out you know you have someone like Warren Buffett coming out there and basically saying Trump's tariffs on goods are not good it's he says that the Tooth Fairy doesn't pay them who pays them Rob do you have that clip yeah do you have that the consumer is going to end up paying them like Pat pointed out there's a $12,000 cars are going to increase the consumer is going to eventually have to pay him so you might make the case that we have been treated unfairly and we do need to do something but that might not work out well in the end we're about to find out like Pat said you start with a negotiation tactic you throw out it's like the art of the deal right throw out something big and bold see what they do oh all right you're going to make a move and now we negotiate you have that clip with Warren Buffett uh yeah give me one so basically he says tariffs are actually we've had a lot of experience with them they're an active War to some degree so the reason that I said the AC of war is that's the Israel R analogy go ahead experience with them they're they're an act of War to some degree how do you think tariffs will impact inflation over time there are attacks on on Goods I mean you know the Tooth Fairy doesn't pay them Ian you always ask love that J always say and that one so is there an answer for that when when people say you know inflation persists consumer prices keep going up when's the end in sight no prices will be higher 10 years from now and 20 years from now and 30 years from now and what do you think about what's happening in Washington right now technology changes things all kinds of things but Washington is Washington and the problem with politics is that you you tend to have to make tiny compromises as you go along well these are these are the pains though right that we're going to have to go through because what so what's what's everybody else so he's doing this why because they're all screwing us over because it's not reciprocal is that is that am I right that their tariffs are how much how much not all of them not all of them some of the countries that that he's doing are reciprocal tariffs but just so you know after the announcement that was made this morning Rob if you want to pull up the story that Apple just uh released Canada I think just put a tariff on 155 different 15 comp some Industries there's a um let me just tell you what just literally this just happened this morning right now as this is coming out um Canada put 25% tariffs on 105 us Goods okay and uh uh you have uh China added 10 US companies to its unreliable entity list and 15 companies to its export control list primarily targeting defense and intelligence firms and China is now filing a lawsuit within the World Trade Organization against the us over the new 10% ter so they're going to go back and forth right now they're going to be doing that and then you're going to see who's going to be able to you know last the longest time until something flips trust me what Trump's not GNA want is he is pushing in my uh the way I'm processing this he's pushing the pressure now because he doesn't want the pressure to be pushed six months nine months before midterms he does not want that okay when midterms comes and he loses the control let's just say because the Market's not good he doesn't want that so whatever strong positions he wants to take he better take it right now he will not be able to do it next year that's all it is next year you're gonna see a very much of a measured right before midterms and then again strong push coming right after midterms and then it's the end of it I fully agree with pbd and even the numbers show that you know how our friend Tom says words Talk number scream here's an article CNBC this was from a couple days ago the first quarter is on track for negative GDP growth says the Atlanta fed um GDP tracker forecast 1.5% GDP shrink for q1 2025 down from a 2.3% growth estimate driven by weak consumer spending so basically Trump saying listen it might suck for a little bit prices may go up inflation may not be uh what they call that uh transitory so it might stick around for a little bit but it's worth it cuz we're going to shut down the Border we're going to we're going to be treated more fairly we're going to tear up some of these countries that need to be basically treated a certain type of way but like Pat said when it comes towards midterms hopefully uh prices are less volatile and by way we got to you got to take a look at this you scroll up a little bit Rob just scroll it up a little bit I'm sorry can I grab my go for you guys I'm so so sorry no they'll grab it for you Jillian gra they'll grab it for you is it in your purse it's in my backpack I'm like okay go grab it go grab it guys I'm so it's apologize you're fine Vinnie pe's twice a show fine so basically basically what's going on right now nothing nothing to do with Trump what this report is right here right now with consumer spending the consumers ran their credit cards back up to $1.3 trillion bnpl delinquencies were shooting up even before the Christmas presents had been unwrapped the consumer is very tapped out and when you read now the fine print you get behind the headlines that want to say oh because of trump tariffs is no [ __ ] it's got nothing to do with Trump tariffs the Commerce department is reporting personal spending fell 2% in January by the way he wasn't inaugurated till January 20th ladies and gentlemen and missing missing estimates adjusted for inflation fending spell half why the consumer was tapped out at the end of last year and so right now what we have is a president that is trying to get some sanity and equivalent can see on tariffs number one and number two he's trying to set the cons the uh uh the economy up so it can grow but the consumer is tapped out and so I think people need to look at this it's very convenient for the mainstream media to say oh bad Trump this bad Trump that and by the way not everything that's going on in the economy right now is good we got to get it sort out we got to get cool heads to come together and get these equivalent tariff things have to come together but he he didn't get inaugurated till January 20th and the consumer's been tapped out since the end of last year that's a good point you are right I will give you credit where credits due because people spend way too much on the holidays people spend way too much during Christmas people spend way too much Trump's only been president for what is it now 6 weeks 48 days 49 days something like that so but at the same time they're showing signs of decreasing consumer confidence so the whole speculation is that that GDP is on track for negative q1 so he's still going to be the president you know over the next few months so what they're saying is they are tapped out everything you said is correct but they're not seeing it that that it's getting better and they're not seeing the numbers go up what's the stock market returns for the first quarter so far it's barely it's barely even right like it's not up big as of yesterday S&amp;P gave back the gains for the year exactly so it's at even so the point is we're going to see how this works out but all the gains all the I mean what's what's bitco point at right now is it at 90 yesterday I was going to say it was 86 okay remember when it hit 104 whatever it was a couple weeks ago it's at 82 so all the gains that happened over the last month or so have all been given back and now it's even down these are speculative forward markers you're talking about gains with Bitcoin let me tell you what he just announced on truth that the crypto Community is going to lose their mind and they already are Robb I just send it to you those two screenshots and your if you can pull them up uh yesterday I want to say it's yesterday on Truth social the president said the following which could be massive he said this two days ago a US crypto Reserve will Elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration which is my why my executive order on digital assets directed the presidential working group to move forward on a crypto strategic Reserve that includes xrp okay so is that Solano and Ada I will make sure the US is the crypto capital of the world we are making America great again and Rob go to the next one and look what else he said he's going to add because people were wondering and absolute obviously Bitcoin and ethereum as other valuable cryptocurrencies will be at the heart of the Reserve I love Bitcoin and ethereum okay so you know he does this the crypto Community if all of a sudden he puts $100 billion into crypto and it buys xrb they you know they diversify it in a way they're going to be doing that that's going to be a very interesting move I mean the Bitcoin conference is going to be insane because finally the US has a crypto Reserve so you're right on what you're saying so far but remember when you're trying to change the way people think and you're trying to change the way relationships are internationally you have to do it right off the bat because two years is going to come in no time midterms and that's exactly what he's doing we won't know if these things are working properly or not till probably end of summer in my opinion I'm saying September October I think it's going to go that long in my opinion for us to relase if it's going to be a good or not AOC asks NPR host to clarify the problem when he asks about migrant crisis voters go ahead Rob what extent is immigration as an issue part of your problem with workingclass voters I mean I I guess my question would be what what does the word problem mean people voting for the other side and not for you feeling that feeling that Democrats are not serious about the issue in ways that it concern them I think that we have a problem on immigration because of the lack of progress that we've had on this issue um and as we know Republicans weaponized that lack of progress of course there was famously a bipartisan Bill last year that Republican majority in in the Senate and also in the house were willing to pass President Biden was willing to work with them on it and Donald Trump said do not solve this problem as long as it is broken um then it will be politically beneficial for us going be making a point it is a problem not just for Democrats all right so so while while they're having this exchange about immigration right at the same time California is waiting for Harris decision in a governor race while Tim wals is saying he may consider running for what do you call it uh uh president in 2028 so California is sitting there saying is this Harrison going to happen is it not going to happen you know is the race something that you know cuz Newsome's going to step aside with him starting a podcast and maybe this is a chance for Harris to get in is she gonna be vocal about it when she was there the other day the reason why I went from AOC to Harris to Walts to you know what we just talked about with fedman is who is actually going to be the face of 2020 for the Democratic party Jullian you're you're you're you know you've spent time with a lot of folks from the left and even you know you you're recently kind of been in a different place who do you think and maybe if you were an adviser hired St Julian who would you get behind on the left who would that person be gosh the one who is the least woke and seems to put their head down and do the best job and focus on the issues at hand I originally said Josh Shapiro um but I didn't realize that there may or may not be some scandal in his background and he's not my Governor but when I look at the landscape I I don't know who they've got they've all just completely lost it remember when clovershire used to make sense a 100 thousand years ago it just they've all completely moved so far left that I I just don't think they have a candidate which is why guys like Bill are grasping its straws like Federman remember I remember when she said listen I'd love to staple a diploma under everybody's chair here in the room and give you free healthcare and free college and free this and free that but it doesn't work that way and her search went up exponentially overnight because people knew she wasn't bullshitting them she was telling telling the truth now she's just unrecognizable to me politically and I I I guess I would say Shapiro Tom you think it's going to be usual suspect I just I just typed it in right now just to see I don't know what Google searches what they're doing the other day at CPAC the leader was JD Vance and number two was Steve Bannon for CPAC for Republicans right Steve Bannon was two behind JD Vance okay so JD Vance he became a star but on the left you see Nome you see Whitmer you see Shapiro you see West Moore you see Buddha who else is it going to be a usual suspect or is it going to be somebody else so what happens and this is not my opinion I mean let's go back and look at history whenever you have situations like this come up the party looks around and we all citate and look at this person look at that person look at this person look at that person you know uh you know Antonio Vos holy [ __ ] he's still alive you know in from LA right and all those things coming up well will come back to the top is name recognition because they realize that the voter the majority of the voter 80% of those that vote are living in short attention span theater they will go to name recognition and that's why I believe right now and I'm not trying to prognosticate I believe this is going to be Rick Caruso versus kamla Harris because both parties are going to go to name recognition however on the the Republican side Rick Caruso critic of the wildfires strong guy on sensible policies to rebuild Los Angeles and California but I think at the end of the day the reason they're all waiting for kamla is because she's the choice of the of the of the Democrat establishment that's why they're waiting for her they're not saying hey if you don't make a decision in 10 minutes we're going this way and and Antonio vosa and and m kakales is they're each going to get 15% of the of the preliminary money no that's not what they're saying they're saying we're waiting on her because all she has to say is I'm doing it and we're going with her because that's the name recognition they want and if you go back and look at um how primaries and a lot of things happen that's usually how it shakes out you're saying for the governor of California or for the president he he's talking about he's talking about the gubinatorial that's what you're talking about I'm talking about the the decision in the governor's race presidential talking about presal Tom was us about minutes Tom can't even imagine one of them as the president so we just dropped it down to governor no no it was I thought we fed you oysters last night we Dr like good vitamin food answering the question about the California govern watch this here Rob this is what you pulled up Rob has this here Harris at the top is what what side is this Rob this is from 538 okay so 538 has Harris at the topz then bu Edge then Walts look at these people then Nome Nome is fourth as of right now Ocasio Cortez is fifth Whitmer Shapiro Cuban then it's fedman pritsker waro Booker COC COC seriously Crockett like from from Miami Miami Vice there you go I'll get i'll get an 80s reference not a 40s reference you know who who the Crockett is is that the COC is that Jamie Jasmine C no way no CL not her oh my God she's the worst wow they have her on that list okay great let's see what the next name is uh uh uh polus and M Basher and Galo GGO more and Smith why even put them on there they're at zero% there a 34% type of a thing Vinnie what do you think uh well first of all can we go back to the kazio aocc which I Adam you made a great observation I think she's pregnant I'm just going to throw that out there that's a was the first thing I thought when saw I thought she was because the last video she made anyway that's besides the point she is a liar her saying well it's good to know that she thinks that women can have babies they they got for that I know if she knew she is a absolute lying through her teeth and shame on him for not saying anything she's talking about that border bill that Trump didn't want and that they said no and they don't care about migration no no that border Bill had $60 billion going to Ukraine um 14 million going to Israel and 4.5 billion going to Taiwan so she's full of of poop okay but I think the language please I'm sorry Tom apologize but and I said don't make me laugh that be the worst thing do that let her breathe they have zero the Democratic the left the party is absolutely cooked look who they have to pick for even that KLA Harris it's it's you guys the Democrats that are even listening to this you have Stockholm syndrome you have fallen in love with your freaking abuser and like you said Julian they they can't make the switch even if like listen like they're going to need a SA they're going to need like somebody like a stepen A Smith They'll crucify that person they burn they will burn his ass to the ground because no what do you mean St let's just be honest if Sten they're never going to embrace a guy like that he's going to call him out on their [ __ ] but they need that's what they need Trump did ini what they need but that's need take what they want I understand that that's my point but here's the actual point the only way they're going to have hope Adam is that type of [ __ ] somebody to come in like a trump and flip the whole table listen let me tell you the current status of Democratic party and it does not give me great pleasure to say this is they got they got no hope and Bob Hope and Bob Hope's been dead for having like they got nothing it's completely up for grabs at this point the fact that Tim Walls is like yeah I'm thinking about hand Tim Walls listen tampon Tim sit this one out KLA Harris was the worst candidate they ever run in our lifetime and she's in first place this broad's in first place so if you're a republican congratulations cuz you guys in my opinion is still the guy can I ask you your opinion we'll see what happens with that no way not after the fires there's just no chance he's gonna play a Billy Joel song He's GNA say We Didn't Start the Fire he's going to do a little rally it's not even going to be cleaned up by the time no plan to clean it up you realize that there's nobody in charge of this mess literally there's no one cleaning up the wreckage and the Carnage out there and this is going to haunt him I I disagree you give Democrats that you give the left that much credit that even the Slick wiie talking with this podcast in the first line of his uh his promo was let's change the conversation that's you you think do do you genuinely think so I don't think there listen a lot of them have moved to a place mhm where they're never trumpers but I would vote for a republican mhm just never Trump that's that's what you end up hearing um they don't do any homework on the fact that the things they're outraged about their own party did 10 times more of for example immigration illegal immigration it's like well you know Clinton deported 12 million people you know Obama deported three million people and Trump deported one like where was your outrage those are Obama's cages did you do any homework I mean Biden ruled back all of trump Trump's border policies and with the swipe of a freaking pen they could have stopped this but they didn't but so so beyond the fact that no listen they've planted their flag they're blue but they really do hate this guy he is hated throughout the state I'm seeing it more and more with people that are far far left and you're starting to hear things like I would vote for Republican just never okay so let me ask you this Julian Michaels hypothetical those people you're talking about the blue no matter who they're never trumpers and they hate Gavin Nome they do he is hat if you're looking at a ballot and they see Gavin Nome versus Donald Trump but Donald Trump's not who are the hypothetically who are they going to vote for so that's my point but Trump is not going back in Jance or somebody it's called hypothetical but but if you give them someone that is more moderate that that they can kind of get their head no I don't think so I think I think the part to look at that that was the most impressive of what happened to America out of all the data points that everybody was showing well let me tell you Pennsylvania this well let me tell you about this and let me tell you about this you know what the most shocking data the fact that every state in America became more Republican but out of all the states that became more Republican two States became more Republican than any other states you know what those two states were California New York yeah crazy that was the weirdest day you're like what remember that whole thing with map with the pink thing y you're like are you serious so I don't know I don't know they've been hit the hardest by it pat that's why yeah I mean you know you know what I would do if if if Trum if Nome is coming out to the day to announce that he's running for president that day if Trump's Camp really wanted to pull off a great troll get a hold of the DJ influenc the DJ to play a walk up song and the song is by Starship We Built This City right built this city to say e this city right like if there's one burnt burn City Lial policies right we burned this city we burn this city on Lial policies that's what they got to say We Didn't Start the Fire burin n's been so the point is I mean dude the part that with Americans today with social media you the world has become like Dory from Finding Nemo oh my gosh that's so accurate hi what's your name I'm Patrick True Hi V how hi hi oh co never happened hey hi right so this thing that that people are so quick to forget what we forgot about the essential nonessential we got to take care of J Michael don't I just can't laugh right you know how many people were getting the nonessential remember Gerard I think Gerard got the tattoo didn't he get didn't Gerard get a tattoo non-essential think he did people were like dude screw you like the part the biggest part is anybody that's in the documentary business anybody that's like the people that do a great job there's so many of these guys phenomenal job all of those documentary people have to make sure take five companies have five different documentaries to produce launch them all in 26 and then one in 28 just to remind everybody what the hell happened because they're going to forget and that's the biggest thing if you create a documentary about California fires and what led to it I guarantee you and you'll launch it in 20127 that documentary is directed to Nome because he's going to run okay then you run a documentary if you intentionally time these things to make people smarter everyone's forgetting about what happened like Michael Jordan you know what what static have a note section in my phone of purely one thing and I collect Michael Jordan debate things okay and look at this I if I find it it's like I you know young boys collect pictures of you know whatever pictures it is yeah for me it's stats of Michael Jordan Kobe debate you know which one I just found check this one out crazy I Rob I want to send this to you just to play it just so you see cuz people forget about who Michael Jordan really was right they forget I saw this stat that I'm like holy [ __ ] what this guy did the question is how many 50 50 win teams did people eliminate in the playoffs okay 50 win teams all right they have Michael on the list they have Kobe on the list they have magic on the list they have Tim Duncan on the list they have Larry Bird on the list they have a LeBron James on and everybody wants to say LeBron James the greatest right can you do me a favor and pull this picture I just I just found this right look at this okay Kobe eliminated 25 5 win teams Michael 20 Duncan 18 magic 13 BD 10 LeBron has 12 and LeBron's played twice as many seasons nearly as Michael Jordan he's at 12 Kobe 25 why is this important people forget Michael they forget who Michael was they forget they forget what the sky did right so everybody's just today they think about LeBron LeBron LeBron we have to make sure documentary folks produce the best documentaries reminding us what happened to California reminding us what happened to co because by 2027 2028 a lot of people are going to forget okay let me go to the next story this next story is very important and Julian I I kind of need your help with this one here because we got you know we got a lot of guys here we kind of want a little bit of perspective so uh why men can't help falling in love faster they screw this thing up I don't see that let me read it let me read just maybe let's tear this guy apart if the argument is terrible Australian National University researcher that's the qualifier Australian National what's going on over there found men fall in love faster and more often than women averaging 2.6 times versus 2.3 times and saying I love you a month earlier per a study of 800 people ages 18 to 25 the team notes falling in love 1 month earlier provides men with a greater opportunity to use romantic love to promote courtship with men nearly twice as likely to fall before a relationship starts driven by a fitness landscape favoring quantity of potential mates women take longer they take 1.92 months to develop intense feelings but once smitten they dwell on partners 54% of waking hours versus men 44% of waking hours showing deeper commitment researchers explain females begin choosing than males seek quality over quantity contrasting men quickers Plunge Into Love as an honest signal of commitment perti biology of sex differences Journal do you agree with this no tell me why okay here's why there's a joke about lesbians so you've got female energy squared right what do they bring on a first date a U-Haul that is not a joke about straight men or gay men in other words women instantaneously are like oh my my God I love you let's move in together let's that's a notoriously female thing so you get two of us together and that's where you end up so I I'm going to say no a lot of my guy friends like they take a long time and they're they're very Discerning and women nowadays I'm sorry to say this I I I this is going to be very unpopular but I think that they sleep around too much and I think they give themselves away too easy I think that makes men lose interest pretty quickly and I find that all my guy friends tend to wait for the girl that made or fall for the girl that made them wait I I know that's not going to be popular but it's it's what I've observed the course of my life make a movie about that was a lady something uh the book that became a uh movie you ever seen act like a woman think like a man yeah that's what it is think yes Think Like a Man act like a lady something like something like that Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man became a movie Act a very good movie and he had a rule of 90 days so in the movie they're fooling around the guys like dude what I'm about to freaking go crazy like you got to wait 90 days you got to wait 90 days you got it's actually a very very funny movie you will laugh your ass off Rob can you type in Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man movie Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man movie see that's it that's it think like a man that's the movie oh my God Kevin Hart's in it Vinnie it is Absol you know who the other guys in there you know who that gu from The 40-Year-Old Virgin was like did you write this did you write this too girl I did F show damn bit who talks like this you ought you know what you don't talk like that to ladies right but but do you agree Tom do you agree with what Jillian's saying and then I'm going to come to Adam do you agree that men you know because this article saying men fall in love faster she's saying no what are your thoughts uh I don't I get to feel you know at least my generation the men are a little pickier and they may be you know um remember there there's there's two speeds for men right there's men that give fake love to get sex and then women that will give sex but they get fake love right and that's like the fallacy that's a fallacy of the hookup generation can't believe talking about Adam live on the air like that but so um I think men men tend to be men tend to be pickier and are less less quick to want full commitment go ahead that's great that's what I think what a breakdown Adam your thoughts I'm gonna say this out loud Tom's absolutely right Bingo I'm telling you right now I know guys play home player Tom did you cut the Tom gang gang but I do know men who basically are like I love you baby like oh my God and the women like oh my God and they might use that line from time to time they're full of sh and then maybe they're like really good-looking guys and maybe they do that and they say that and then they end up marrying Kim Kardashian I know a guy that did that right between the lines but or there a real litter in Miami here drink this true all right Tom you're reing a little too much now but I tell men this all the time I got you I got you there we go I tell the men this all the time w a dark spin Tom's a dark dude go ahead bro he went men if you need any advice when it comes to women it's this try your best I know it's going to be hard to not fall in love with your eyes cuz some of these girls especially on the Graham especially on these dating apps damn they look good but there's something called face tune there's something called push-up bras there's something called plastic surgery there's come something called makeup these girls look damn good I'm just going to say it that you know like what the whole joke with uh Dave Chappelle he's like you know I'm talking she looking good I'm like she's wearing a turtleneck and her titties are still popping out of chest like like sorry about that Tom I know that you know your Hummer lifestyle ain't about this but for men you see a girl and it happens and you're like oh my God and you're like think I love her like I love her and then the makeup comes off you know the dress comes off she has a penis you don't need that yeah is in your house exactly whereas women exactly it's The Crying Game for men there's a difference between love and lust one of our guys went through it in Brazil when were in Brazil yet oh really I just learned about Kim petris the other day I told you the guy who had a great suit on not the guy with the great hair say Antonio but the point is men fall in love like so quickly because they fall in love with their eyes damn you look good and then they get to know her then you find out she do let me ask question hang on hang L same thing but you're not going to say hey baby I'm girls it says love that is not love how many girls have you said I love you to Adam how many girls have I what time is you that you meant it I'm actually very protective with with with my don't hold him somebody hold him how many times um

like that Tom today and last night I had great deal of respect we're going to go to pbd now we're going to go to pbd now oh because you know it's his show we're going to ask him a question I've had her DVDs on my shelf for 20 years I told her that last night was love next year Taio videos there were his wives but still that's right how many women have you said i' love you to I think it's two two two obviously Jen no it's three because it's three three yeah it's three maybe I am very like that is not a word I dropped it's like a it's you're selective so risky yeah and why is it risky the amount of commitment and like stuff that comes with it no like listen I like you so much yeah oh that can't go over I like you so much we're almost there but I like you maybe one day I'll love you but I like you how how'd that work out for you guess what it wasn't Public Relation I had a lot of private relationships that I if you walk next to me publicly it's um it's a statement to the market so I I was very selective so if you're with me publicly I'm telling the world you're you're mine this is a serious thing going on but if it's private like friends would go out they're like hey man who's this girl I'm like like when a dog pees on a tree but it's like a girl it's got to be like marked I like great job Jen locking this so no it's not book yeah no oh hold on how long did she make you wait whoa how long did who Jen how long did she make you wait oh same night what are we talking about what imag J's going nuts in no it was a minute it was a minute because we we went through we went through the book that we read there was a whole process of and I was at a place cuz I was dating four girls at the same time and I was telling all of them I'm not being promiscuous I'm trying to look for a wife there was four girls I liked and I was talking to all of them and every every one of them asked me please don't because I knew the girls for many years she knows the girls Jennifer knew the girls as well I'm like look man this is kind of where I'm at if we get to the next phase I'm looking for a wife I'm not looking for a girl so it was four girls and then boom who's the last one that slept with you last one that slept with me who slept with you who held out the longest trying to prove a theory here I've been married for 15 years we've been together for 18 years dude I don't even know like but out of those four I I'm I'm guessing Jen was the the hold out yeah I I would say yes probably and but I would say the the the three I don't know no you weren't dating Jen at the same time you were dating the other three like Jen was separate right no no we I'm talking to all four of them this is very public very very public it was very open it wasn't something that I'm like you know beating around the bush it was like Hey I'm not ready but if I know we can go through the questionnaire let's see where we're going to be at and then boom four kids later uh we're at 15 years and I think we'll make it to 16 we take one year at a time that's marriage one year at a time so you know after like a big argument family whatever issues bunch of [ __ ] happens uh Sports Center ESPN MC shows up so how is everything going on you know what we're just taking a one day out of time just marish thing and CU we got to get back and go go to the draw board and look at some of the you know video focusing on the eag we're watching tape and we're going to figure it out we're going to figure this thing out and see what we're going to doou kind of how this works man this is all right let's do one last story and then we wrap up um and Vinnie's going to take me to the hospital yeah I got okay Julian I'm so sorry this is what happens when you have kids they still infect you it's unbelievable ungrateful little get from other kids by the way you know let's do this one here uh so conservatives explode at botched Epstein document roll out complete disappointment okay and Vinnie's one of them Rob is that a clip that you have we go I want to go to the next one and then we'll wrap it up if you have this is this Jesse I have Jesse Waters and I also have Pam Bondi Pam Bondi discusses a dump trunk full of docum I saw this one go and play this clip go for it we all did and the FBI handed over a couple hundred of pages of documents but you know Sean um I gave them a deadline of Friday at 8:00 a.m. to get us everything and a source had told me where the documents were being kept southern district of New York shock so we got them all by hopefully all of them Friday at 8 A.M thousands of pages of documents um I have the FBI going through them and cash is also now that we have cash here it's a game changer of course and cash is going to director Patel is going to get us um a detailed report as to why the FBI withheld all of those documents okay I want to be clear because I think people got got frustrated because they were expecting more you were expecting more and you didn't find out less than 24 hours before the release you got a whistleblower that confirmed that there were way more documents that they had were supposed to turn over and then you found out just before that well sure and you're looking at these documents going these aren't all the upstein files you know they were flight logs there were names and victims names and we're going where's the rest of the stuff and that's what the FBI had turned over to us and so a source said whoa all this evidence is sitting in the southern district of New York yeah so based on that I gave them the deadline Friday at 8 a truckload of evidence arrived it's now in the possession of the FBI cash is going to get me and himself really a detailed report as to why all these do doents and evidence had been withheld and you know we're going to go through it go through it as fast as we can but go through it very cautiously to protect all the victims of Epstein because there are a lot of victims you had identified then the next one you have was is it anything different with Jesse r or no uh no more just him questioning there are some interesting ties that he does bring up to the sdny and who is investigating this case you want play so who's in charge at the New York FBI field office James Den who's withholding Epstein doc from the attorney general James Dene is running the show there there he is this is the guy who emailed his whole staff to dig in after Trump took office and don't forget that James comey's daughter is an assistant us attorney for the southern district of New York and weird she worked on the Epstein and Maxwell cases she's kind of knee in this Epstein was facing sex trafficking charges in lower Manhattan where's all that paperwork the FBI sees computers surveillance banking records file cabinets and photographs from all of Epstein's properties in New Mexico the Virgin Islands Palm Beach and in New York the justice department also gave Epstein a sweetheart non-prosecution deal 17 years ago where are those files the Bureau of Prisons where are those files you remember where Epstein killed himself I asked Bill bar about that why everything seemed to go wrong that night hm when I first heard all the information and all the coincidences here I was suspicious what were the coincidences I mean those were a lot of coincidences well one of the cameras was out right uh he was supposed to have a cellmate cellmate left they didn't replace the cellmate uh and the guards who were supposed to check them every half hour didn't check so you here's kind of where I'm going to this all right so let me tell you where I'm going with this so then the story says let me just tell you that Jay Maxwell considering presidential pardon and d d da from Trump she's seeking this she's seeking pardon which guess what if she's prompting to seek I'm liking that and I'll tell you why J for 20 years from pardoning from president Trump or old friend per a Tallahasse prison source to the mirror they all know how close she once was to him she tells people often enough often enough after Phil 2023 climing Florida shielder signing friends now push what has she to lose okay noting the Trump's recent Pardons and her silence on Epstein Trump and Epstein okay all right so that's that story Vinnie for you I have my thoughts and I have a solution I have an idea that I think a lot of people if you're supporting this share it but I'm going to go to Vinnie first you hear this how do you feel about it well first of all James Den so if you guys didn't catch what he said he's the head of the of the FBI's New York field office he was forced he didn't just bounce he was forced to retire because they accused him Pam bandi and all them because he's hiding thousands of f why would this guy an FBI agit because mind you Cas pel's in I think people there's a misconception Jillian that people think that all the people that are in all of a sudden switched and now they're Pro Trump and they're Pro this agenda and that's not the case just like back in um uh with uh Russia collusion with Peter struck Andy McCabe Lisa Page it was all we're going to have an insurance policy and when for him to say we're going to dig in that means those same people are still in charge and they're still protecting each other and uh James comey's daughter guys you guys all remember who Jamie James Comey is the Trump hating Hillary Clinton covering up guy his daughter is the assistant us attorney for the southern district of New York where all these documents are so as much as these people are promising us I still Vincent oana don't think it's still going to see a light of day because all those people guys we have to understand what this was whoever he worked for FBI informant mad CIA let's just say he was working for all three there is footage there is a tape of all these Elites all these higher ups that you guys all are thinking about the allegedly Bill Clinton uh um Bill Gates all these higher-ups there's footage of them and the fact that that they're not it's not going to see the light of day shows you how powerful these people are the phone calls that are being made seeing saying don't you guys dare put that [ __ ] out because guess what your friend your your brother your whatever we have footage of him cuz I'm almost I've been saying this forever imagine uh Jillian you go to this island and you're all there chilling you go home and you think life is good and you get an encrypted email that says Hey listen we want X Y and Z you're a governor you're a president whatever and you say no they go oh yeah click on this link and it's you with an underage person that you had no idea about they got you for the rest of your life it's over I don't think anything's going to come up that cuz all these people are all connected judges politicians too right you know and you're in there playing hide the salami with his underage kids and now being honest hey guys just on fire today man I'm a little bit we can just shut it down already I have an inhaler in the other room if you need it to recover from that but guys no Tom CU I mean horrible what hor go ahead man by the way you know like at least 500 kids are Googling right now what is hide the SL don't do that what the heck you're a dad goodness like this is bad go ahead Tom well you're free but go ahead go ahead no I more rope go ahead you give a more rope P go ahead Tom we found the salami go ahead don't tell wait I mean first of all you want to give us more details where is the salami from what part of Italy is it Milan is it you know CH if you're going to go there tell what do you want to do we're going to mod the this is the essence this is the essence of blackmail this is the same reason kind of black nobody is talking on right cuz everybody's caught everybody's caught but why does it have to be a blackmail because it's Diddy like what's the they're known they're known for certain black male like m a l e or m a i l no it's it's you know extortion andion just trying to see like Tom Kim whatever you did to Tom this morning he is wild just so you whatever you did those but let me tell you my idea here here's my idea coffee seven is my limit tell me what you think about this tell me what you think about oh my gosh okay so you know how the question is hey we're going to go find if the gold is at Fort Knox okay by the way do you know since the Inception of Fort Knox it cost $540,000 to build they build it in one year and after they build it they moved roughly 400 50% of our gold is at Fort Knox that's hidden there they have Security on top of security on top of security that's in this place do you know since then the first time till today how many times have opened it up to be seen three times how many years how many years in 70 years it's only been three times 8 years only three times people have gone in to see if the actual gold is there and no one's ever touched and audited to see if all the gold is there right so what does Trump say Trump and and you know why they chose this place they bought 40 acres of land they wanted it to be in a place that doesn't have earthquake no fault line uh fault line no nothing like that they do get hurricane and tornado in this area cuz it's in uh uh it's in Kentucky right Rob it's like 20 miles outside of Louisville if I'm not mistaken very interesting thing about Fort Knox and guess what Trump and uh musk want to do they want to go visit this place you know if you really want to know oh man what happened with uh Epstein you know what I would do I'm going to go VIs visit Jay Maxwell oh I'm going to go and say hey I'm the president I'm sending cash Patel and Pam Bondi to come and talk to her and let's strike a deal we'll give you a lifetime protection that nothing can ever be done to you if you tell us everything about everything it's a lifetime uh uh what do you call it pardon and a safe place the negotiation if if when Sammy to B his deal they allowed him to do facial surgery to reconstruct the way he looks so the audience wouldn't recognize him if they say we'll do anything and everything to make you go back to having a normal life etc etc but tell us all of it they can do that can't they th% they will they do that no way way knows all of it already if they get involved with her it implies a connection I last night Vinnie was talking about how if Trump par her he's he's voting for Kam yeah I'm voting for Kam if if Donald Trump I'm saying well well that's a whole different situation if they just because she's saying like now Vinnie hold on you're saying you're voting for kamla why I was she's joking about the comma thing but if first of all if we don't get to if they don't get to the bottom of this in this four years and if Trump pardons her without that type of stipulation I am cuz because you know where I'm going back to I can't give a [ __ ] about the the [ __ ] people are perverted they're going to have to deal with God it's the children the underage kids that these people have destroyed and no the the the lack of care for kids in this [ __ ] country drives me through the W like it like and they're like we're going to cover the victim's names okay that's fine I want from day one we've been saying accountability but if this if nothing happens and every day P every single day I'm posting We were promised the JFK we were promised 911 we were promised Epstein and nothing's happening I'm counting business days we're on day seven that [ __ ] um uh influence oh oh look at I'm holding that was a a [ __ ] show that was embarrassing what are you guys what are you guys doing and there's children involved there's kids involved you guys have kids you guys have kids imagine that 12-year-old that was there oh right here you were you were raped and then they potentially kill you let and we're go and we're and we're playing this game it's absolutely ridiculous so if they do that I mean that's a great idea I mean if she spills the beans but if they just pardon no I'm not I'm not playing that game bro I'm I voted for the this this is what I voted for for the country to be back for the border to be closed and for these demons these demons to be held accountable like fouchi this he pardoned everybody he pardoned everybody I want F get the state involved we we deserve one person I don't give a [ __ ] who it is I don't care if it's Bill Gates or whoever I want one person going to jail one give us one is that asking for too much Tom no and it seems pretty simple the federal government's in possession of all these files yeah we don't need redact the kids names and the things that you need to redact um and then let's see it's not like you have to investigate it you've you you have everything and if there is a you know if you've got you get you pardon Maxwell and she gives you the names of celebrity number 81 you know and some poor slep celebrity goes to prison right it's sort of like the end of the movie The Big Short where the only guy that went to jail was that one guy from deuts Bank remember yeah and they go to the end of it and they say you know everybody went to jail actually no no one went to jail they all went on doing what they're doing except this one guy from deuts bank if that's what they do then I think it you have less trust after than you have right now thank you I agree well I think the one person that did go to jail was Jan Max she's the guy from Bank yeah well I mean she's a sacrificial L she was the offal L yes but she was there the whole time so I don't know I mean I think Andrew Tate brought up a good point I know that's your you're big fan Jullian and he says look and I understand where you're at I understand that there's have to say about the he basically said listen they said there's going to essentially said listen are we really going to bring down this person and this person at the expense of a hundred billion doar at the expense of whether Bill Gates way or whe whether it's Leon black whatever name whatever amount of money are you really going to open up Pandora's Box I we have to to put this one person in jail never going to happen and risk all this all your jobs all your livelihoods all your houses all your kids college tuitions all your grandma's this this that do you think it's worth that do you think do you personally think it's worth it knowing exactly what these people did and what was the point and meaning and look at all the all the policies and stuff because depends on but what you mean these people if it was Epstein who was The Mastermind he wasn't the master he was the guy that they they put in place just like the for me it wouldn't like to get as Tom alluded to celebrity number 76 to throw him in jail as a sacrificial lamb what does that do is that is that really going to help you sleep better at night cuz they put one random I don't I think none of them nobody went there that was random cuz if one of them Falls at him that's the thing they're all going to fall they're all going to fall but but Tate did say it's like this kind of soap opera that like for people who are just in this like don't like but see and I disagree with him I'm it's not you should have told her to his face no but he he was going on his rant I I don't agree no I I push back because I don't Adam it's accountability for those kids even though God all those people at least I could sleep well at night that they're going to have to meet their maker and if you read the Bible Matthew 16:8 says what if you make any of these young ones stumble or sin it's better for you to tie a millstone around your neck and throw yourself in the deepest depths of the ocean meaning go kill yourself go die pretty clear don't mess with the kids and that's the problem and we just look it over I don't give a [ __ ] about billions or how we suffer let I want to know who the hell was doing what and that's I think it's who was behind the entament piece that they don't want us to know of course not the entire operation I think is the Scandal I mean cuz it's like okay prince Andrew blah blah blah maybe Michael J okay you know no one's shocked to hear that celebrities are creepy perverted or deviant it's like it's not new news you the have known a fastic point she just made the people cuz think about Adam FBI informant CIA mad you that you know what that means great Point these people were cool with underage kids having sex like and raped and whatever because they wanted to put leverage on politicians actors and [ __ ] what nobody even talks about that that was your plan that was the the black m exactly what I'm saying that's why we're never going to die to do what right well now that they've levered them what did they do with the leverage God only knows that's God and that's you're right that's another thing okay so let's say it was mad so it was mad behind Levering but for what purpose what they do with a lever influence that's the bigger rle crazy why are we like why why okay I get mad I get he was an FBI aform on top of that's the one thing we he still work for Mad do we know that I didn't realize we I did not's father worked for massage let's just back up what do we know for sure that he was an FBI informant well because you just heard about this a couple days but you never heard about mad did you never hear about mad I've heard a lot of things okay but what do we know gain Maxwell's Father Robert Maxwell worked for he was an agent I mean Tom's obsess dad worked for a 99 cent store doesn't mean Pat works for 99 Cent Store what do we know for sure Vinnie show as he was a key witness in the trial of two Bear Sterns executive D yeah but that came out in 2018 yeah that was 2018 new yeah this isn't new I'm with you what just came out this past week that Epstein definitely was well no no no look at me what do you mean I don't know if he definitely did you do research on this story I didn't do rearch he said he's an FBI informant who's they and they've been saying that he was a Massad agent for years so maybe he could be B I thought it was CIA could I didn't realize it was confirmed was FBI wasn't it confirmed he was an FBI The Daily Beast just did an article about it was not confirmed I don't know I mean there's literally no news arle stating that okay so who came out with that former FBI listen my you know where I stand so then my bad going they came out with that those people are going to hell learns out turns out I'm a victim of the fake news wait wait a minute wait a minute just to be fair to Adam a lot of people were saying that it came out that he was an FBI story came out a few days ago so but this has been this has been popular since 2018 these claims have been made mad is when I had his brother on and we spoke it was very fishy rob you remember this when we at the two-hour podcast with Mark Epstein what was the fish just it's very obvious there's something very weird going on with the connections and the support and the people that they had but I don't disagree with that but way it just hasn't been concluded you know you know when you know when uh uh you think about certain people who joined the army who was the football player that joined the military after P Pat Tillman right and he leaves a multi-million doll contract to go serve the military and that epic picture look at that just that guy just looks like a soldier look at that face right you know what's going to happen I don't know who and I don't know how and what the community is going to be if nothing comes out there's going to be some people that are going to be running just on this they're going to be like you know what I'm going to go and run for office cuz I have to find out what's going on there there's going to be some people that'll do that who that is I don't know because I don't know if that is in Trump's top five list I don't know if it's in his top 10 list I really don't think it is I don't think it should be he never ran on it I don't think it's a top five or top 10 list I think it's something that some of his audience wants just like the crypto Community the this community the that Community but I don't know if it's on his top 10 list we'll see you know cash patella supp supposed to be the one that's like hey I'm telling you Glen Beck is here in two weeks I'm telling you in two I'm telling you in two weeks days all right got it no problem what happened that thing went viral that day on XG nothing happened well we'll see we'll see what's going to happen be patient patiently aggressive you don't think nothing will happen Zipp the one thing that did
